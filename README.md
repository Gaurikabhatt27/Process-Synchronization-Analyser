# Process-Synchronization-Analyser
Analyzes thread sync issues in real-time. Finds deadlocks, races, and suggests fixes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synchronization Analysis Toolkit
A comprehensive suite for detecting and resolving synchronization issues in software systems.

🚀 Features
📊 Module 1: Static Code Analyzer
Purpose:

Identifies potential synchronization issues (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks) through static analysis of source code.
Key Details:

Supports Python

Uses abstract interpretation to flag unsafe patterns (e.g., missing synchronized blocks, shared mutable state).

Output: List of vulnerabilities with code locations.

🔍 Module 2: Runtime Monitoring Engine
Purpose:

Detects actual synchronization issues during application execution.
Key Details:

Instruments code to monitor thread interactions.

Tracks lock acquisition order, thread scheduling, and shared resource access.

Alerts on observed deadlocks/race conditions.

📈 Module 3: Visualization & Recommendation Dashboard
Purpose:

Interactive visualization of analysis results with actionable fixes.
Key Details:

Timeline view of thread interactions.

Auto-suggests fixes.
